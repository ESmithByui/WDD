        <h1 class="question">Is this a good trip for kids?</h1>
        <p class="answer">Absolutely! White water rafting is a good trip for children of all ages. We have found however that children over the age of 8 seem to enjoy it more overall (And parents especially enjoy it more if their children are all over 8). A common concern from parents is that their children will be bored stuck on a boat for hours at a time. Surprisingly there seem to be very few bored children of any age. The areas you can raft through are some of the most beautiful in the world, and you never know what you might see around any corner. Not to mention the rapids which keep things very interesting.</p>

        <h1 class="question">Is whitewater rafting safe? I don't even know how to swim! Can I still come?</h1>
        <p class="answer">As with all adventure sports, there is an inherent and assumed element of risk. To help ensure your safety, have at least person who is skilled in wilderness survival and firstaid. The most common injuries are sunburns and injuries that occur on land. Everyone on commercial rafting trips wear coast guard approved life vest or personal flotation device (PFD). Many non swimmers go on rafting trips and have a great time.</p>

        <h1 class="question">What do I need to bring?</h1>
        <p class="answer">Make sure to bring all necessary camping equipment. This includes a sleeping bag, foam pad, waterproof duffle bag, small waterproof day bag, tent and a cot, eating utensils and camping chair. Bringing plenty of food and water is also a must. The most effective way to plan for temperature and weather changes is to be prepared for both hot & dry and cold & wet. Rain jacket and rain pants, do not bring ponchos. Quick dry shirts and shorts long sleeve cotton shirt and pants help keep you cooler on hot days. Button down shirts provide more sun protection on the neck. Light Weight Cotton Pant, Nylon Pant or Sarong the best thing for men to wear are swim trunks as shorts. If you are cold natured, bring polypropylene long underwear top and bottom. Women wear swim suits or quick dry underwear and sport bras as a base layer during the day. Over the base layer, wear a pair of quick dry shorts and the shirt of your choice (polypropylene if you are cold, cotton if you are hot). Two piece swim suits are convenient when changing or going to the bathroom. A large brim hat offers protection from the sun with a good quality strap. Sunglasses with strap socks are used for hiking and to protect your feet from the sun. If you're not used to hiking in sandals or water shoes, bring a pair of shoes you have hiked in before. Bring something comfortable to wear around camp. Cotton dresses, skirts and sarongs are all popular options. For sleep wear you might choose to sleep in your camp wear. Otherwise, you might like to bring something comfortable to sleep in. Bring a water bottle, small day pack for hikes, moisturizing lotion, headlamp or flashlight, moleskin, waterproof sunscreen, and lip balm. Optional items include a pair of gloves, fleece jacket, towel, bandana, small pillow. Hygiene products you might bring are toothpaste, toothbrush, tissue, nail clippers, feminine hygiene products, extra eyeglasses or contacts, biodegradable soap and shampoo. For some fun activities and to enhance your expecience we suggest bringing camera equipment, books, watercolors, or even a journal and pen.</p>

        <h1 class="question">What is so great about whitewater rafting anyway?</h1>
        <p class="answer">Are you kidding me! What's not great about whitewater rafting! Let's describe a common day on the river.
            Arise in the soft light of the early morning after a night spent sleeping under a beautiful starry sky. Have a hearty warm breakfast of fresh blueberry pancakes or omelets to order, then pack your things and prepare for the day. The day is filled with some combination of swift water, rapids, calms, hikes, history, geology, stories, and more good food. We try to hit camp around 4 or 5, after setting up your cot you can relax with a good book or good company by the river, or explore around camp while your guides prepare your dinner...something perhaps like steak and potatoes, or grilled salmon...and dutch oven brownies...you won't forget the dutch oven brownies. After dinner it's more relaxing, and you might even be able to talk your guide into another story or two to send you off to bed under more stars than you thought were possible.</p>

        <h1 class="question">How far in advance would I want to book my trip?</h1>
        <p class="answer">If you have specific dates you need, we recommend booking a year in advance. If you can be more flexible 6 months in advance is usually sufficient.</p>
