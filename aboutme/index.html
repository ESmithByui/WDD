        <p>Hello! I'm Emory Smith and this is my second semester in college at BYUI!</p>
        <p>At college I am currenctly working towards a degree in computer science. I have also chosen to pursue a minor in finance.</p>
        <p>My current hobbies include playing video games and Dungeons and Dragons. As for video games I do like Minecraft as well as Ni No Kuni games and Ace Attorney.</p>
        <p>I'm not currently in any relationships.</p>
        <p>For advantages on taking this course, it helps me with different forms of coding and also might come up later as something I wish to pursue full time.</p>
        <p>I've been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints essentially since I was born. I do have a favorite quote from a general conference before I was born however.</p>
        <p>In a recent sacrament meeting, a lovely young lady suggested that a good talk should begin with a little tasteful humor or an outrageous falsehood. My ability to convey humor is virtually nonexistent, but I can say with deep sincerity that I feel perfectly comfortable and free of fear as I stand at this podium. (David H. Burton, A Season of Opportunity)</p>
        <p>I love this because it accurately represents the classic humor of a sacrament meeting talk.</p>
